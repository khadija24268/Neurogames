# Cognitive Assessments App

This repository contains a **React Native** application built with **Expo**, leveraging **Bootstrap** for UI styling and **Firebase** for backend services. The goal of this project is to digitize cognitive assessments (traditionally done on paper) and provide an easier, more accessible way for both patients and doctors to administer, track, and review these assessments. It includes separate **patient** and **doctor dashboards** for streamlined data management and enhanced user experience.
